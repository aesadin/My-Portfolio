    <h2><em>Who am I</em></h2>
    <div class="p">
      <p>My name is Allison Sadin, I am 29 years old and I am currently a student at Epicodus in Portland Oregon. 
      I moved to Oregon 8 years ago with the intention of moving into community development and local government.
      Before moving to Portland, I lived in California where I studied astronomy and astrophysics. My love for 
      science is strong, soon after graduating from Portland State University with a political science degree,
      I realized politics was not the path for me.
      </p>

    <div class="p">
      <p> Although my formal education is in political science, I always had an interest in STEM.
      I chose to move into programming so that I could exercise my love for science and creation, 
      while harboring a deep sense of team-building and development. Ultimately I see myself leading,
      hopefully settling into a project management role in the longterm, but gaining experience
      with a dedicated group of like-minded programmers until then.
