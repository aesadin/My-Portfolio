        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Allison Sadin, I am 29 years old and I am currently a student at Epicodus in Portland Oregon. 
          I moved to Oregon 8 years ago with the intention of moving into community development and local government.
          However, before moving to Portland, I lived in California where I studied astronomy and astrophysics. When I moved to 
          Portland, I began studying an under graduate degree in Political Science.
          Soon after graduating from Portland State University with my bachelors in hand, I realized politics was not
          the path for me.
        </p>
        <p>Although my formal education is in political science, I always had an interest in STEM.
          I chose to move into programming so that I could exercise my love for science and creation, 
          while harboring a deep sense of team-building and development. Ultimately I see myself leading,
          hopefully settling into a project management role in the longterm, but gaining experience
          with a dedicated group of like-minded programmers until then.
