  <h2></h2>
  <p>My name is Allison Sadin, I am 29 years old and I am currently a student at Epicodus in Portland Oregon. 
    I moved to Oregon 8 years ago with the intention of moving into community development and local government.
    Before moving to Portland, I lived in California where I studied astronomy and astrophysics. My love for 
    science is strong, soon after graduating from Portland State University with a political science degree,
    I realized politics was not the path for me.
